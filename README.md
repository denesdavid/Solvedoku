# Solvedoku
Solvedoku project made for my grandfather's birthday.

With this small software you can solve:
- Classic sudokus: 4x4, 6x6, 9x9, SudokuX
- Puzzle sudokus: 9x9

## Solver source:
**_The solver mechanism is not my intellectual product_, I fixed some bugs in it and implemented the 6x6 solving function in the past!**  
I found it on a forum a long time ago, so I wanted to put here the author but nowadays the source disappeared from the internet.  
**_So, if you are the one, please contact me!_**  

## The used icon sources are the following:

The gear and the help icon is made by me with Inkscape.
